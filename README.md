# COVID-Tracker_App

1.Project Title: COVID-19 Tracker

2.Gist About the Project: I’ve created an app that provides complete current information about the COVID-19 with regional and worldwide statistics and more.

3.Technologies Used: Using the Flutter framework I’ve given the application a beautiful User Interface, I’ve used animations which makes it more appealing. For user authentication, I’ve used the Firebase Authentication service. Also, I’ve used a coronavirus API that provides the live data.

4.Conclusion: I’ve created this application so that people don’t always have to open google and keep searching for COVID statistics and other related issues or help, I’ve provided everything in an application.

5.Future Scope: People can use this application until COVID ends.
